National Level Project Exhibition held at Bharathiar University, Coimbatore, Tamilnadu, India.\n\n\nAbstract :\n\nWe need to enhance the safety measure by our system to notify the person like gas leakage detection and notification system and Automatic Restroom cleaning notification system. Gas leakages results a difficult issue in family unit and different regions, in this way the proposed gas spillage discovered. With the sensor is utilized to identify gas spillage at home. On the off chance that the gas spillage is detected naturally it will send SMS to the client. WIFI and GSM module is one of the most utilized systems over the world. Consequently, load cell has been utilized to screen the heaviness of the LPG gas normally. On the off chance that the gas in the chamber shows a worth where the rest of the rate level is crossed underneath the limit level(threshold) set for gas to be shown as getting discharged. Thus, answer warning will be sent to the client about the leakage. Simultaneously, application programming is created to find the gas leakage in the specific area. By our system it is also possible to clean the public restroom. If it is awful smell is exhaust, then the notification is send to their contractor and its cleaning agent.\n\n\nUsing \n-\u003e Arduino Uno\n-\u003e ESP8266 ( Wi-Fi module)\n-\u003e GSM
